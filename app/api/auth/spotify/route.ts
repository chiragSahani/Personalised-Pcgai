  // This is a placeholder for a Spotify API integration.
  // A real Spotify integration would involve an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow:
  // 1. Redirect the user to Spotify's authorization page.
  // 2. Spotify redirects back to your callback URL with an authorization code.
  // 3. Your server-side route exchanges this code for an access token and refresh token.
  // 4. Store these tokens securely (e.g., in a database, not localStorage for production).
  // 5. Use the access token to fetch user data or recommendations.
  //
  // For this demo, we're mocking a profile fetch.
  // The `getProfile` function provided in the prompt would typically be used with a valid access token.
